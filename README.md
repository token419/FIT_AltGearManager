FIT Alt Gear Manager for Elder Scrolls Online

WARNING: This addon will auto bind items to you when it equips them, if you care about that, this may not be for you.

This addon helps manage gear for alts or new characters under CP160 still. The addon itself won'tl actually do anything when it starts up if the character is above CP160. The focus is to stop worrying about gear so you can just play the game. 

There is no setup, simply equip your preferred armor, weapons, and jewelry and the addon will auto monitor and upgrade them for you.

For Weapons, if the weapon is of the same category TYPE, i.e. Destruction Staff (Fire, Lightening, Ice), 2h (Axe, Sword, Mace), 1h (Axe, Sword, Mace, Dagger), it will upgrade that category, not the individual weapon type, i.e. if a 1h sword is in hand, and a dagger dropped and is better, the dagger will be used. I may implement a check in the future to override this if the abilities that modify weapon behavior based on type are unlocked.
