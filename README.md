FIT Alt Gear Manager for Elder Scrolls Online

This addon helps manage gear for alts or new characters under CP160 still. The focus is to stop worrying about gear so you can just play the game. This addon will auto bind items to you when it equips them, if you care about that, this may not be for you.

Simply equip your preferred armor/weapons loadout and this addon will auto upgrade them for you.

This addon will also upgrade your jewelery based on your attribute points spent. The idea here is that while leveling, you mostly only run across the traits Robust, Arcane, and Healthy, and the addons auto aligns out of those 3 based on your attribute points spent.
More points into Stamina, it will pick the Robust trait
More points into Magicka will pick the Arcane trait
More points into Health will pick the Healthy trait
If all 3 are equalI Robust will be chosen as priority.

Things to keep note of. Currently this addon does not evaluate the quality of the item, purely the level and armor/weapon power. I would like to come up with a way to include quality in the comparison to make the upgrades even better.
